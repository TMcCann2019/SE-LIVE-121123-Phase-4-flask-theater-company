# 2.âœ… Initialize the Api


# 3.âœ… Create a Production class that inherits from Resource

# 4.âœ… Create a GET all route
# 4.1 Make a get method that takes self as a param
# 4.2 Create a productions array.
# 4.3 Make a query for all productions. For every production in productions make a dictionary from the production with all of it's attributes. append the dictionary to the productions array.
# 4.4 Create a response variable and set it to:
#      make_response(
#         jsonify(productions),
#         200
#     )
# 4.5 return the response
# 4.6 After building the route run the server and test it in the browser
# 4.7 âœ… Add the new route to our api with api.add_resource

# 5.âœ… Serialization
# This is great, but there's a cleaner way to do this with Serialization that will allow us to easily add our associations as well.
# Navigate to models.py for Steps 6 - 9

# 10.âœ… User our serializer to format our response to be cleaner
# 10.1 Query all of the productions, convert them to a dictionary with to_dict and set them to a list.
# 10.2 Invoke make_response, pass it the production list and a status of 200. Set make_response to a response variable.
# 10.3 return the response variable
# 10.4 After building the route run the server and test it in the browser

# 11.âœ… Create a POST route
# Prepare a POST request in Postman under the Body tab select form-data and fill out the body of a production request.
# Create the POST route
# ðŸ“š Review With Students: request object
# 11.1 create a post method and pass it self.
# 11.2 create a new production from the request.form object.
# 11.3 add and commit the new production
# 11.4 convert the new production to a dictionary with to_dict
# 11.5 Set make_response to a response variable and pass it the new production and a status of 201
# 11.6 Test the route in postman


# 12.âœ… If not done above, add the new route to our api with api.add_resource

# 13.âœ… Create a GET one route
# 13.1 Build a class called ProductionByID that inherits from Resource.
# 13.2 Create a get method and pass it the id along with self. (This is how we will gain access to the id from our request)
# 13.3 Make a query for our production by the id and build a response to send to the browser.


# 14.âœ… Add the new route to our api with api.add_resource
